This is a mod/plugin for the obscure masterpiece that is [Pig Eat Ball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/339090/Pig_Eat_Ball/).

Trying to do a speedrun of the vanilla game would be really annoying given that it lacks an in-game timer and
it has a bunch of unskippable/useless menus.

Nobody's done a speedrun of Pig Eat Ball due to its hidden gemness and the many anti-speedrun features it has, so I built this plugin
to make speedrunning it feasible and plan on being the first to try!

If through some miracle you're reading this and you decide to speedrun this game, here's how you can use this plugin too.


## What does this plugin do?

*WARNING: I've yet to complete a full speedrun of the game using this plugin, for all I know it'll blow up right at the end of the game and prevent you from completing it. Use this plugin at your own risk.*

- Adds an in-game timer that stops during level loads and stops in the pause menu except when you're menuing (for more consistent runs between players using more or less powerful PCs and to allow you to take small health breaks during a long run).
- Skips the clam talking menu and the medal/pearl award menus (avoids you having to mash and saves you a lot of time).
- Turns off the Steam leaderboards (skips the delay that they add).
- Automatically skips the level start menu (avoids you having to mash and saves you a lot of time).
	- If you want to use a powerup or change your disguise, you can press left/right on the DPAD (or a key defined in the config if you're playing on keyboard/mouse) to avoid skipping the menu.

## How do I install this plugin?
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/strategineer/speedrun-tools-peb/releases).
2. Unzip the release so that the BepInEx folder is next to pigEatBallGame.exe.
3. Play Pig Eat Ball.
4. [Optional] Press F1 to open an in-game config UI to change settings (mostly to turn the plugin on/off).
