# speedrun-tools-peb

This is a mod/plugin for the obscure masterpiece that is [Pig Eat Ball](https://store.steampowered.com/app/339090/Pig_Eat_Ball/)
to make speedrunning it feasible.

Trying to do a speedrun of the vanilla game would be really annoying given the lack of an in-game timer (that
pauses during level loads, etc.) and the fact that it has a bunch of unskippable/useless menus.

Nobody's done a speedrun of Pig Eat Ball due to its hidden gemness and the many anti-speedrun features it has, so I built this plugin
to make speedrunning it feasible and plan on being the first to try!

If through some miracle you're reading this and you decide to speedrun this game, here's how you can use this plugin too.


## What does it this plugin do?

- Adds an in-game timer that pauses during level loads (for more consistent runs between players using more or less powerful PCs).
- Skips the clam talking menu and the medal/pearl award menus (avoids you having to mash and saves you a lot of time).
- Turns off the Steam leaderboards (skips the delay that they add).
- Automatically skips the level start menu (avoids you having to mash and saves you a lot of time).
	- If you want to use a powerup or change your disguise, you can press left/right on the DPAD (or a key defined in the config if you're playing on keyboard/mouse) to avoid skipping the menu.

## How do I install this plugin?
1. [Download the latest release](https://github.com/strategineer/speedrun-tools-peb/releases).
2. Unzip the release so that the BepInEx folder is next to pigEatBallGame.exe.
3. Play Pig Eat Ball.
4. [Optional] Press F1 to open an in-game config UI to change settings (mostly to turn the plugin on/off).
